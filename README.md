# My-Projects

This is my project's repository! This will serve as a practice for me, focusing on projects for web design, Python, Java, and C! Posting them if I'm ready :D

MOOD TRACKER:
A file will be created with the headers: Date, Time, Mood, Description, and Intensity, and avoids rewriting by breaking into a new line every time, and tells the user if the file already exists in the directory where they're writing this code 
1. New Entry - One can enter what their current mood is, why that mood is, and how intense it is; that automatically appends it to the file following the headers (time and date automated). Errors are accounted for if the input is not among the choices (ie, user input & intensity)
2. Check the file - See the contents of the tracker as to what entries are made
3. Quit - exit the program
